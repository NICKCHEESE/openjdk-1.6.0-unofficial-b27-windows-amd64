 openjdk-1.6.0-unofficial-b27-windows-amd64.zip for Metasploitable 3



This repository is to hopefully fix any issues when trying to build [Metasploitable3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3) manually. The original file download link returns a 404 which causes the build to fail. 

I pulled the file from the Way Back Machine and confirmed the hash calculations match.

Sha256 calculation taken from original source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexkasko/openjdk-unofficial-builds/master/checksums/6b27/openjdk-1.6.0-unofficial-b27-windows-amd64.zip.sha256

## You can either:

Download the [install_openjdk6.bat](https://github.com/NICKCHEESE/openjdk-1.6.0-unofficial-b27-windows-amd64/blob/main/assets/install_openjdk6.bat) file and replace the one in the Metasploit3 folder `some\directory\metasploitable3-master\scripts\installs\install_openjdk6.bat`

OR

Just change the link to point to the download in this repo:  ```https://github.com/NICKCHEESE/openjdk-1.6.0-unofficial-b27-windows-amd64/raw/main/assets/openjdk-1.6.0-unofficial-b27-windows-amd64.zip```
